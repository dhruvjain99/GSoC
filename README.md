It was an incredible learning experience with GSoC and Rocket.Chat! I can't believe three months have passed so quick that I'm writing this final report, summarizing all the exciting work I did in these Summers

## Project Abstract

+ The goal for this project is to integrate chatbot platforms like **Dialogflow** and **RASA** with **Rocket.Chat**.

+ These integrations are built to work with the **Livechat** module of Rocket.Chat. Livechat is a modern helpdesk application that helps connect a live-agent with a visitor so that the live-agent and answer visitor's queries.

+ With these new Integrations of Dialogflow and Rasa, Rocket.Chat will now allow site visitors to interact with a Bot instead of a live-agent. These Bots would be developed and maintained on Dialogflow and RASA.

+ This is a very common approach which most of the businesses use nowadays, where a visitor would first interact with a Bot. These bots can handle simple interactions like answering FAQ's for a business, to complex interactions like ordering an item. If these bots are not able to answer visitor questions, then the visitor would be transferred automatically to an online live-agent who can address their query.


## Work Product

The final product / deliverable for this project is in the form of **Rocket.Chat APP** which is now published on Rocket.Chat Marketplace üöÄ. Here are a few screenshots of both these apps:
